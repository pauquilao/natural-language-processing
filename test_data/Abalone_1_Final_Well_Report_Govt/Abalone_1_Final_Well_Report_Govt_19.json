A total of 0.1 days on October 18th (see DDR # 47) was lost due to this incident. The seal assembly did not give a positive indication of completely setting and was not able to be directly tested with the casing hanger running tool. It tested to 55158 kPa (8000 psi) with the test plug. Cause is believed to be extremely heavy cuttings gathered in the wellhead area when circulating casing prior to and during cementation. The large amount of circulation was required due to the well instability ultimately due to reactive/pressured shale."}, {"id15": " "}, {"id16": "Abalone 1 Final Well Report\u2014Govtdoc Page 20"}]
