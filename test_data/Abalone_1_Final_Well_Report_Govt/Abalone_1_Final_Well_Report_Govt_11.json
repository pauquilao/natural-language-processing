Whilst running in, ledges were encountered just outside the shoe and a ledge at 3823 m was unable to be passed. A second logging run with the CSAT tool was aborted when the tool failed before reaching the casing shoe. A second VSP tool (SAT\u2014B) was then run in the hole and was unable to pass 3660 m. An attempt at recording a checkshot survey initially failed due to a problem with the air\u2014gun. The tool was pulled into the shoe whilst the airgun was repaired. A successful checkshot was finally recored from 3660 m to 1550 m. At the completion of the wireline logging, an FEWD tool (RLL\u2014Acoustic Caliper) was made up and washed and reamed to bottom. After successfully logging the 216 mm (8 1/2\u201d) hole the FEWD tool was pulled to surface.
