The tool string stopped at 3605 m. The second logging run (FMS\u2014GR) was then run , stopping at 3596 m. The third logging run (MDT\u2014GR) obtained pressures from 7 stations out of 24 attempts. The final logging run (CST\u2014GR) shot 30 bullets and recovered 29. At the completion of the logging, a clean\u2014out trip was made and 244 mm (9 5/g\u201d) casing was run and set without any problems at 3599 m."}, {"id6": "The BOP\u2019s were tested after the casing was run after which several attempts to run the wear bushing failed.

The BHA was pulled out of the hole and replaced with a directional BHA and drilling continued to 3703 m. The drilling assembly was pulled and the BHA and the bit changed and then the drillstring was run back in the hole. Drilling continued to 3832 m when slow penetration rate necessitated the changing of the bit so the drilling assembly was pulled out of the hole. With a new bit, the drillstring was run in the hole and drilling continued to 3896 m at which point the MWD failed. The drillstring was again pulled out of the hole and the MWD replaced. Once back on bottom, drilling continued to 4014 m where a trip out of the hole was required to change the BHA. Some tight hole was experienced on the trip out. Once out of the hole, it was discovered that the MWD had lost some hardened steel inserts from the resistivity tool. The clean out assembly was run in the hole and worked through the open hole section with frequent reaming and washing required on the way in and out of the hole. A total of 115 g of junk was recovered from the MWD and CST tools. A BOP test was performed and a leaking upper [BOP was discovered."}, {"id8": "After replacing the [BOP, the new BHA was run in the hole and drilling continued to 4795 m with regular trips and some tight hole. Mud gas readings increased at 4773 m and the well was conditioned and the mud weight raised to 1.42 SG. The well was static and drilling continued to 4795 m and the mud weight was raised again to 1.44 SG. Dummy connections indicated the well was still underbalanced and the mud weight was raised to 1.48 SG and the well was circulated whilst waiting for Barite. Several dummy connections were performed and mud gas still remained high as the mud weight was increased to 1.62 SG. A short trip was performed with some tight hole encountered. Dummy connections and circulation whilst increasing the mud weight continued until the gas levels were negligible, at which point the mud weight was 1.70 SG.
