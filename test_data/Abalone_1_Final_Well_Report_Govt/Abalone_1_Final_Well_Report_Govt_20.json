It is believed the seal assembly was setting slightly high and would not allow the wear bushing to correctly engage. Problem was believed to be caused by excess cuttings in wellhead area."}, {"id6": "6.5. Tight hole in Jamieson Formation"}, {"id7": "Tight hole conditions and annulus packoff during trip from 4014m caused lost time from 1030 hrs to 1430 hrs on October 27th (0.2 days see DDR # 56). Tight hole conditions believed to be due to stressed shale and possible under balance. This tight hole may also have been responsible for heating up the BHA which could have lead to the failure of the MWD."}, {"id8": "6.6. Sperry MWD Junk in the Hole"}, {"id9": "The Sperry Sun MWD tool left 40 pieces of hardened metal inserts from the resistivity tool downhole. A clean out trip for junk from Sperry MWD was performed causing lost time from 0145 hrs on October 28th to 1330 hrs on October 30th (2.5 days see DDRs # 57\u201459). The Sperry MWD tool failed down hole due to heat when working tight hole whilst packed off and unable to circulate cooling mud. The tool suffered 3 separate heat related failures and left junk in hole. The clean out trip again encountered very difficult hole conditions related to unstable shale. The hole needed to be drilled with higher mud weight."}, {"id10": "6.7. IBOP Failure"}, {"id11": "The topdrive\u2019s IBOP failed to test during a BOP test. Lost time due to this was from 2100 hrs to 0400 hrs on October 30 & 31St (0.3 days see DDRs # 59 &60). No reason for the failure has been determined.

The final LOT was 1.69 SG EMW at the 244 mm (9 5/8\u201d) casing shoe. The drill string had to be pumped out of hole due to absence of a trip margin. The bottom hole pressure was estimated to be 75842 kPa (11,000 psi). The well was unable to be deepened beyond this point due to pressure limitations of the well control equipment and well design."}, {"id14": "6.9.
