Drilling with seawater gel sweeps continued with"}, {"id9": "a 660 mm (26\u201d) hole to 732 m where the 508 mm (20\u201d) casing was run and set at 725 m. The marine riser and BOP was then run and tested."}, {"id10": "A 445 mm (17 1/2\u201d) drilling assembly complete with downhole motor and MWD was run in the hole and 2 m of new fonnation was drilled prior to performing a leak\u2014off test to 1.34 SG EMW. Drilling continued with seawater and gel sweeps to 1254 m where an increase in pump pressure was noted. A trip out of the hole was made to remove the motor that had parted at the bearing housing. The motor was replaced and the BHA was washed and reamed into the hole. Drilling continued to 2208 m where a decrease in ROP is noted. A trip out of the hole was made with regular tight hole causing the assembly to become stuck temporarily in the Grebe Formation. Losses increased significantly during the trip. After returning to bottom with a new bit, drilling continued to 2487 m where another decrease in ROP was noted. A trip out of the hole was made where it was discovered that the saver sub on the mud motor had sheared leaving the mud motor and the bit in the hole."}, {"id11": "A fishing assembly was made\u2014up and run in the hole, washing and reaming through tight hole and temporarily becoming stuck in the Grebe Formation. An attempt to recover the fish was unsuccessful. A clean\u2014out assembly was then run in the hole, again requiring washing and reaming. The clean\u2014out assembly failed to tag the fish and drilled to 2504 In prior to be pulled out of the hole. Damage to the assembly indicated that it had drilled alongside the fish. A cement stinger was made\u2014up and run in the hole and a cement plug was pumped with theoretical top of cement at 2364 m. The top of the plug was tagged at 2415 m, 15 m below the lowest possible kick\u2014off depth. A second cement plug was pumped with the theoretical top of cement at 2330 m. The cement stinger was then pulled out of the hole."}, {"id12": "A sidetracking assembly was made\u2014up and run in the hole and the top of the cement plug was tagged at 2340 m. Attempts to sidetrack the well failed due to the difficulty in keeping the inclination sufficient. The sidetracking BHA was pulled out of the hole at 2447 m and a cement"}, {"id13": " "}, {"id14": "Abalone 1 Final Well Report\u2014Govtdoc Page 9"}]
