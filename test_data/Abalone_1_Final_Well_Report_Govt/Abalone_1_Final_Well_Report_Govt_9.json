Once at pumping depth, just prior to pumping cement the stinger became stuck at 2443 m. After 21 hours of jarring and pulling the pipe became free and was pulled out of the hole. A clean\u2014out BHA was then made\u2014up and run in the hole and a clean out trip was performed, after which the cement stinger was run in the hole and sidetrack plug No. 3 was set from 2447 m to 2325 m. After a short trip the cement plug was tagged at 2331 m. A fourth cement plug was then set from 2331 m to 2226 m. During a short trip the pipe became stuck and after several hours of working, became free. The cement stinger was tripped out of the hole and a cleanout trip was performed with a 445 mm (17 1/2\u201d) bit before a sidetracking assembly was made\u2014up and run in the hole (Figure 3)."}, {"id5": "Drilling of the No. 2 445 mm (17 1/2\u201d) sidetrack hole commenced from 2240 m and continued to 2560 m where a decrease in pump pressure and string weight required a trip out of the hole. Once at surface it was then discovered that the BHA below the 203 mm (8\u201d) accelerator was left down hole. A fishing assembly was made\u2014up and run in the hole. The fish was engaged and pulled out of the hole with the first attempt."}, {"id6": "A new BHA was made\u2014up and run in the hole. Whilst washing and reaming at 2318 m the BHA became stuck. After several hours of working the pipe, Schlumberger was rigged\u2014up and a free point indicator was run. After 31 hours of working the string it came free. The BHA was pulled out of the hole, washing and reaming tight hole, and a clean\u2014out assembly was made\u2014up and run in the hole. The hole was conditioned with gel mud and the 340 mm (13 3/3\u201d) casing was run and set at 2547 m. After cementing the casing the BOP equipment was tested."}, {"id7": "A 311 mm (12 1A1\u201d) BHA was made\u2014up and run in the hole and 3 m of new formation was drilled and a leak off test was performed to 1.15 SG EMW with 1.05 SG KCl/PHPA mud. Drilling continued to 3004 m where low penetration rate necessitated a trip out of the hole to change the bit. Mud losses commenced in the Prudhoe Formation at 2486 m. A new bit & BHA was made\u2014up and run in the hole and drilling continued to 3355 m where a trip out of the hole was made to change the BHA and bit to a kick\u2014off assembly. The directional hole was kicked\u2014off from 3355 m and directional drilling continued to 3384 m where the gas readings began to rise rapidly with 1.10 SG mud. The well was shut\u2014in with no gain observed and no casing or drillpipe pressure was observed. The mud weight was raised to 1.12 SG and a short wiper trip was performed. After the trip, the mud weight was again raised to 1.13 SG and drilling continued to 3419 m where difficulty was experienced in keeping the toolface constant. A trip out of the hole was performed and the angle on the motor increased to 1.500 prior to running back in the hole. When back on bottom no motor differential / reactive torque was observed and no readings from the MWD were possible whilst sliding. The well was circulated and another trip out of the hole was performed. The motor from the previous run was made up with an angle of 1.500 and run in the hole. Drilling continued with regular wiper trips to 3616 m where indications of increasing pore pressure we noticed.
