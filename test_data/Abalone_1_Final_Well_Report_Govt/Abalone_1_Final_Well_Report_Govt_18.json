The Puffin Formation sandstone is expected to be sealed by marine claystones of the Prudhoe Formation and the Echuca Shoals and Upper Vulcan Formations sandstones are expected to be sealed by marine claystones of the Echuca Shoals and Jamieson Formations."}, {"id9": "Abalone\u2014l encountered a thin gas interval in the Puffin Formation overlying a water leg. Hydrocarbons were encountered in fractured limestone of the Fenelon / Gibson / Woolaston Fonnation and in siltstone / sandstone interbeds in the Echuca Shoals Formation. Figure 15 shows the lithology for Abalone\u2014l. Abalone\u2014l encountered overpressure up to 1.69 S.G. at a total depth of 4795m and was plugged and abandoned due to safety considerations."}, {"id10": "5.2.
