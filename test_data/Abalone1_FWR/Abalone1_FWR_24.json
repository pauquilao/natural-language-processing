The FEWD was tested and the assembly was run to the 13 3/8\u201d casing shoe at 2547m. After the |.B.O.P was replaced and pressure tested, the bit was run to bottom. Directional drilling re-started from 3419m and reached 3487m where a 50kle drag was encountered and cleared. Drilling on, the pipe was further worked from 3490m to 3465m interval. Drilling continued and at 3550m returns were circulated and then a 10 stand wiper trip was conducted. Once back on bottom, drilling resumed and at 3613m, the hole was circulated clean. After a static flowcheck, a slick wiper trip to the casing shoe was conducted. The hole was circulated out and the bit was then tripped to surface to perform wireline logging."}, {"id18": "Bit Run 20 Summary"}, {"id19": "RR 10b.
