The pumps were started and reaming was done from 1746m to 2360m. Washing and reaming continued and was slowed down for caution near the presumed top of fish at 2477m. The fish was not tagged and when reaming reached the bottom depth of 2487m, it was decided to drill a few metres of new formation. At 2504m, 50bes of sweep was pumped in and tripping out commenced back-reaming from 2500m to 2486m. The pipe briefly got stuck but was worked free. 200bes of guar-gum and 200bes of hi viscosity mud were pumped and chased with 2000bbls of seawater. A further 200bbls of hivis gel was spotted on bottom before pulling out of hole resumed."}, {"id20": "Cementing Run Summary"}, {"id21": "After pulling out of hole the decision was made to set a cement plug and sidetrack past the fish.

The cement lines were rigged up and tested to 2000psi and 150bes of cement was mixed and pumped and then displaced by the Halco unit pumps.
