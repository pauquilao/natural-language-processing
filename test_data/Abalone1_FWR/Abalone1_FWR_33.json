RIH continued but was held up at 465m. After washing from the tight spot to the bottom, the TGB was successfully landed onto the PGB. Surface lines were rigged up and pressure tested to 3000psi. The slurry was then pumped in and displaced with Halco noting the floats held good. The running tool was then released with the PGB slope indicator reading 1.25deg port while the surface slope indicator read 0.75deg forward. The running tool was then pulled out of hole."}, {"id11": "J apex AC Ltd: Abalone-1 Page 2.2.1"}]
