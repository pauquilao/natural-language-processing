The assembly was run in hole. Washing and reaming was required from 3606 to 3678m and from 3794m to bottom. Conventional rotary drilling was used from 3832 to 3886m. The bit was steered from 3886 to 3896m, to make corrections to the well path, which was beginning to drop angle, but once again, the bit proved extremely difficult to steer as in its previous run. At 3886m, the FEWD tool shut down and stopped sending data to surface. Numerous attempts to re-activate the tool were unsuccessful. It was then decided to change the bit and FEWD tool. Returns were circulated to surface. While pulling to surface, backreaming and pumping was required in tight spots from 3724 - 3678m, 3649 - 3637m (25-30klbs overpull) and from 3637- 3635m (35-40klbs overpull). At the 9.625\u201d casing shoe, the well was checked for flow before the pipe was slugged and the bit pulled to surface."}, {"id28": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id29": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id30": "Page 2.1.21"}]
