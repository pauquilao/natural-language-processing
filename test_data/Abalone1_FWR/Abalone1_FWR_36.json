The casing was washed down from 3592 to the shoe setting depth of 3599m. After landing out the casing hanger in the wellhead, the casing was then circulated with 700 bbls mud, 130 bbls LCM and chased with 20 bbls mud while preparing fluids for the cement job. The cementing unit pumped 5 bbls seawater and the surface lines were pressure-tested to 5000 psi. A 65 bbls drill water pre-flush and 80 bbls dual spacer pill with a weight of 1.32 sg was then pumped. The ball was dropped and the cement slurry was pumped amounting to 135 bbls. The dart was then dropped and the cementing unit pumped 30 bbls drill water before switching over to the rig pumps to displace the cement with mud. A total of 749 bbls of mud was pumped, without the plug bumping. Pressure was bled off and the floats checked that they were holding. The pack-off was set off, but unable to give a good pressure test result. The running tool was released and the landing string pulled to surface."}, {"id9": "J apex AC Ltd: Abalone-1 Page 2.2.4"}]
