[{"id1": "4.1 Pressure Evaluation"}, {"id2": "DxC points inferred normal consolidation of sediments with depth within a homogenous lithology. Although there was a gas peak of 34% at 3384m, the cuttings returns at and above this point and the cavings generated from the subsequent trips did not indicate any change in pore pressure around this depth. The cavings were predominantly blocky, of stress relief structure. The temperature curve dipped lower around 3300m but premix addition to maintain volume at the pits was done at about this depth and in general the temperature trend have constantly increased although significantly lower than the expected geothermal gradient. More than 400m of riser volume have subdued the temperature curve."}, {"id3": "The lower zone of the 12 1A hole section was presumed to have been under tectonic stresses that required an MW of 1.1489 to stabilise the bore wall but the zone was still normally pressured. Despite the hole problems observed on the lower portion, the pore pressure of the 12%\u201d hole was considered to be normal at 1.03sg."}, {"id4": "8 1/2 Hole Section"}, {"id5": "The same KCI/PHPA/Glycol mud system was used in drilling the 81/2\u201d hole section. The mud density was started at 1.268g and directional drilling progressed steadily with the gas background kept at 0.1 to 0.2% level. With the addition of slug mud, the fluid density was allowed to creep up to 1.27sg at about 3800m. Minor splintery cavings were noticed by 3970m when the mud weight was at 1.288g. Drilling then continued down to 4015m. While POOH, the assembly was held up, un-able to circulate from 3995 to 3982m. The pipe was worked up until circulation was regained at 3823m. On the trip in, large quantities of cavings were circulated out from 70m below the casing shoe and also from the bottom. The system was weighted up to 1.31sg and when hole problems persisted, was further raised to 1.40sg. Trip gas ranged from 0.5 to 1.5%, and there was no connection gas noted. Directional drilling resumed and more circulation problems were noted while making a wiper trip from 4252m. The background gas have crept up between 0.2 to 0.4% and connection gases appeared from 4565m to 4749m at a fairly constant amount of less than half a percent with the mud density constant at 1.408g. After a gas peak of 30.9% from 4768m, the mud weight was raised to 1.42sg. The succeeding connection gas at 4777m was 17.3% and a bottoms-up gas was then recorded at 13.7%. At 4795m, to reduce gas levels the mud density was then incremented in stages performing dummy connections each time. The gas influx to the wellbore was stopped by a mud weight of 1.708g."}, {"id6": "The corrected drilling exponent analysis showed two suspected zones of abnormal sediment compaction. These zones are from 4100 to 4230m and from 4490 to 4560m. The temperature trendline throughout this hole section was much more subdued compared with the previous hole section. The generation of sharp, concave cavings indicative of abnormal pressures almost did not occur except for trace amounts collected while circulating and mudding up from 1.62sg after a wiper trip to the casing shoe. The gas background have increased from 4140m and downwards. It must be pointed out that while the dummy connections were constantly kept at 4 minutes and the mud weight incremeted by 0.0289, the volume of gas being released to the static system as quantified by the flame ionization detector have in general, also crept up."}, {"id7": "Based on these observations, the interval from the casing shoe down to 4190m was interpreted to be under tectonic stresses and given the directional hole geometry needed a 1.408g mud to stabilise the borewall. Hole drag to 20kle maximum was considered to be normal and hole cleaning problems were the norm of such deviated wells. It was inferred that a geopressure transition zone could be present at 4190 to 4230m given the onset of increasing background gas. It was further observed that there was a safe, considerable overbalance used during drilling. The overbalance, presumed significant until 4500m, was more than sufficient to prevent the generation of connection gases as well as concaved and sharp cavings indicative of underbalanced drilling or overpressured zone ."}, {"id8": "The overbalance imposed by the 1.408g mud was depleted below 4500m with the first connection gas noted at 4565m. It was presumed that a high gas peak at 4696m was most likely due to an overpressured tight sandstone with very little permeability. This sandstone was the suspected source for the first gas peak, preceding the bottoms up gas by about 70bb|s of annular volume, in all dummy connections subsequently made."}, {"id9": "The Dxc and resistivity data indicated that the formation pore pressure reached a maximum at 4696m and then subsequently decreased toward TD at 4795m. At 4996m the maximum pore pressure was estimated to be 1.69sg as was clearly confirmed at the mud up process. Due to the lack of permeability at this depth, this overpressure was seen to slowly stabilise."}, {"id10": "Japcx AC Ltd: Abalone-1 Page 4.1.2"}]
