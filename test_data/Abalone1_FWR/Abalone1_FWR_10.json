Drilling of cement, the shoe at 726mRT, shoe track and two metres of new formation to 734mRT was completed. The hole was then circulated clean pumping a 50be high viscosity sweep and then spotting a 30be gel pill on bottom. The bit was then pulled back to the shoe and a Leak-Off Test (LOT) performed. With a mud weight of 1.0389, an Equivalent Mud Weight (EMW) of 13489 was recorded. The 17-1/2\u201d hole was then drilled ahead using seawater and alternating high-vis PHG and high-vis guar gum sweeps pumped every 15 metres, with returns being dumped at the shakers. The hole was drilled from 734m to 818m where 6 check shot surveys were taken. Drilling ahead continued from 818m to 1254m with a survey taken every 2 stands. At 1254m a sudden pump pressure increase up to 4200 psi caused mud pump#3 to activate its relief valve. The drill pipe was worked while the surface lines were checked and deemed to be free of restriction. The pumps were re-started and at a rate of 1168pm gave an SPP of 3100psi. Previous flow rates of 24OSpm recorded 2900psi. A blockage in the Mud Motor, MWD or PBR tool was"}, {"id21": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1 Page 2.1.3"}]
