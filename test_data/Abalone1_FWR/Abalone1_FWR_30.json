The junk assembly was run in the hole to the shoe where the drilling line was slipped and cut and the TDS system serviced. The bit was washed and reamed from 3598m to 3670m where bottoms up was circulated. The bit washed and reamed down to bottom through numerous tight spots 3754m, 3763m, 3790m, 3803m(packed off), 3807m, 3820m, 3830m and 3900m. At bottom 4014m the junk basket was worked. A 100be high viscosity pill was swept around the hole whilst 1m of new formation was drilled from 4014m to 4015m. The mud weight was increased to 1.31ppg. After a flowcheck the bit was then pulled out to 3987m where the hole packed off, the pipe was worked to gain circulation and cleared at 3972m. A further 100be high viscosity pill was made up and pumped and the mud weight was raised to 1.37sg. Once weighted up, another 100be high viscosity pill was pumped and the pipe was backreamed pumping out to the shoe with up to 20klbs overpull. The hole was circulated clean at the shoe.
