Tight hole was encountered at 3610m and the bit was washed and reamed down from 3610m to 3680m. Running in the hole continued from 3680m to 3790m. The bit was washed and reamed from 3790m to bottom at 3896m. Once on bottom, the toolface was oriented and a sequence of directional and rotational drilling commenced, with directional surveys taken as required, in order to steer the bit and build hole angle. New hole was drilled from 3896m to 4014m where a flow check was performed prior to pulling out of hole. The bit was pulled out to surface, backreaming with no circulation possible from 3892m to 3823m. Circulation was regained and backreaming continued from 3823m to 3679m where the hole packed off again. The bit was backreamed out with no circulation between 3679m to 3640m. The well was flowchecked at the shoe and a slug was pumped. The trip then continued to surface. At surface the MWD tool was seen to be seriously damaged with around 40 metal antenna protector bands stripped from one side of the tool and left in the hole, requiring a junk recovery and clean-out run."}, {"id18": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id19": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id20": "Page 2.1.22"}]
