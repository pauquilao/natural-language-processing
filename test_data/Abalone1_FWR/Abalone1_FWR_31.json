The string was then run in hole to the 9.625\u201d ca8ing shoe at 3599m. The bit was washed down from 3598m to 3993m with max 30klb8 weight on bit to clear ledges. Washing and reaming commenced from 3993m to 3998m where reaming became solid and the bit was reamed down with 20kle weight to 4012m where the hole started packing off. Circulation was regained and the bit reamed to bottom at 4015m with indications of junk noted between 4012m and 4015m. New 8-1/2\" directional hole was drilled with rotation from 4015m to 4252m with surveys taken every stand. At 4252m bottoms up was circulated and a 9 stand wiper trip was made with tight spots at 4210m, 4205m, 4190m and 4140m to 3995m. The bit was run back/washed to bottom and rotary drilling continued from 4252m to 4536m with a static flowcheck at a drillbreak at 4501m. Bottoms up was circulated at 4536m. A 4.03% gas peak from 4501m and a connection gas of 0.45%ABG from 4515m were recorded. A 10 stand wiper trip to 4228m was performed backreaming on the way out and running in 8lickly to bottom. Drilling ahead continued from 4536m to 4773m with a static flowcheck at 4661m. Connection gases of 02-03% were seen from all connections. A flowcheck at 4773m on a 9.0% gas peak gave a static loss of 30bbl8/hr. Bottoms up was circulated, 6 sacks of LCM pumped and losses were stabilised. A maximum gas of 30.9% was recorded from 4769m. The MW was increased to 1.4289 before drilling ahead from 4773m to 4795m. A bottoms up gas from 4773m of 17.8% was recorded. A connection gas of 17.3% ABG from 4778m and a pumps-off gas of 13.75% ABG from 4790m were recorded. Constant gas levels of 19- 21.0% were recorded after bottoms up, so the MW was raised to 1.4689 and then to 1.4889. Gas level was reduced to less than 1% with 1.5589 ECD but a dummy connection gas recorded 17.9%. The mud weight was raised in stages from 1.48 to 1.6089 performing dummy connections after each 0.0289 weight up resulting in gas peaks of between 19 - 31%."}, {"id17": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id18": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id19": "Wiper trips were made to 4722m (MW 1.689), 4665m (MW 1.6289), 4373m (MW 1.6489) and to the shoe at 3599m (MW 1.6489), with max trip gases of 27.8%, 51.3%, 26.3% and 22.5% respectively. The MW was further raised up to 1.7089 in 0.0289 stages. Dummy connection ga8e8 after each weight up were 31.4%(1.6689), 34.3%(1.688g) and 0.84%(1.708g). The hole started taking losses of up to 50bbl8/hr during the final stages of the weight up to 1.7089 at 4409pm. At 3109pm, mud l088e8 decreased to 15 bbl8/hr and at 1509pm the losses stopped. A 90 bbl LCM pill was pumped and spotted with the pump rate 8|owly increased to 3009pm. Bottoms up was circulated at the rate with no dynamic losses. The bit was then backreamed to the shoe and the well observed from there for over 10 hours to simulate a trip to surface and back to the shoe. The bit was pumped back in the hole reaming tight spots as required. A maximum gas of 0.44% was recorded. A 400be8 high temperature pill was displaced to the bit and the pipe wa8 backreamed and pumped out to the shoe. After a flowcheck pumping out of the hole continued to 981m before finally pulling out to surface."}, {"id20": "Page 2.1.24"}]
