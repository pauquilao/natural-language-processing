The drilling line was slipped and cut and the TDS serviced before the trip continued to 1734m where weight was taken. The bit washed and reamed from 1734m to bottom at 2208m with no fill recorded. Drilling ahead continued from 2208m to 2438m using seawater and alternating high-vis PHG and high-vis guar gum sweeps pumped every stand. Surveys were taken every two stands. Mud returns ranged between 10% and 70% with occasional total losses. At 2438m, during an attempt to make a connection a 400psi back pressure on the drillpipe was noted. The hole was circulated clean to relieve the load on the annulus. Drilling ahead continued from 2438m to 2487m with total losses and at 2447m the riser dump valve was opened. At 2487m, a 200be gel pill was spotted on bottom and the string pulled out of the hole due to poor ROP. On pulling the BHA out at surface it was found that the saver sub on the mud motor had sheared and the mud motor crossover and bit had been left in the hole."}, {"id8": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id9": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id10": "Fishing tool 1 - BHA Run 6"}, {"id11": "The fishing run used an 11-3/4\u201d overshot made up to 8\u201d drill collars.
