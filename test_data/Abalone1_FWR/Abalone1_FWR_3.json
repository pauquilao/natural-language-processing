Data was processed and stored using Drillbyte V.2.3.1 software. All depths were recorded relative to the rotary table (RT) unless specified otherwise."}, {"id4": "Abalone-1 was planned as a 4950-metre (BMSL) exploration well to evaluate the hydrocarbon- bearing potential of the Late Cretaceous Puffin formation and the Early Cretaceous Echuca Shoals and Upper Vulcan Formations within a faulted anticline structure in the northern Browse Basin."}, {"id5": "1.3 Well Diary Summary"}, {"id6": "The well was spudded at 20:15 hours on 04 September 2000, drilling the 36\u201d/26\u201d hole from the seabed at 431m to 478m using seawater and high viscosity prehydrated gel (PHG) sweeps pumped every 15 metres. The 30\u201d conductor was run with the shoe set at 475m. The 26\u201d hole was then drilled riserless using seawater and high viscosity gel sweeps. After reaching section TD at 732m, the hole was displaced to gel and 50 bbls LCM. The bit was then pulled out and the 20\u201d casing run and cemented with the shoe set at 725m. The BOP and riser was then run and pressure tested."}, {"id7": "After drilling out the 20\u201d casing shoe track, two metres of 171/2\u201d hole were drilled and a Leak-Off Test (LOT) was performed using seawater, yielding an EMW of 1.34 sg. Drilling started using seawater and alternating guar-gum and pre-hydrated gel sweeps made every 15 metres. Returns were dumped at the shakers. A trip took place at 1254m to replace mud motor after bearing housing parted. Static losses ranging from 78 to 220 bbls/hr were recorded on flow checks but partial returns were maintained. However, at 2208m while circulating the hole clean prior to a bit change, total circulation was lost to the formation. On the way out, the hole was tight with back-ream-torque reading up to 15 kftlbs. The string got stuck at 1922m but was worked free with 30-40 klbs of overpull. On surface, the MWD probe was changed out and a 25.6 lb/ft drill pipe landing string was picked up and racked back."}, {"id8": "A new 171/2\u201d bit was picked up with the MWD tool and mud motor and run in down to the casing shoe. The top drive was serviced and the drill line was slipped and cut as per program. RIH continued taking weight at 1734m. The pumps were started and washing and reaming was done to the bottom which was found to have no fill. Drilling new formation resumed with sweeps made every half a stand noting good hole condition on connections. Drilling returns was intermittent varying from nil to 80% of the flow rate. The riser dump valve was opened at 2447m when the annular fluid level was observed substantially lower than the flow-line for a considerable time. Good returns however was visible on the seabed. Due to very low penetration rate, the bit was tripped out at 2487m and on surface It was found that the saver sub on the mud motor had parted leaving the lower part of the mud motor and the bit in the hole. An overshot assembly was made up and RIH to recover the fish. The hole was tight at 1813m where reaming started. Gel was pumped in as necessary and reaming continued until an obstruction was tagged at 2439m. Attempts to pass the obstruction were unsuccessful. The fishing assembly was then tripped out back-reaming through tight spots as required. A hole conditioning assembly was then made up and run in hole. The obstruction was cleared but the top of fish was not found at the expected depth. When reaming reached TD at 2487m, it was decided to drill a few metres of new formation to clean up any debris. After drilling 17m to 2504m, the bit was tripped out of hole and a stinger assembly was run in setting a cement plug on bottom to kick-off a sidetrack hole. The stinger was pulled 10 stands back and after WOC for 4 hours was RIH to tag the TOC. The TOC was much lower than necessary so it was decided to set another plug from 2340m to 2415m. The stinger was then pulled out and while WOC for 24 hours a new sidetrack assembly was picked up and rig maintenance was carried out."}, {"id9": "Japex AC, Ltd: Abalone-1"}]
