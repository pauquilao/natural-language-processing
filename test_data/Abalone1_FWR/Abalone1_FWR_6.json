[{"id1": "Operations Summary"}, {"id2": "whilst a high viscosity pill was swept around the hole. The bit was pulled back to the shoe and then to surface and the bit and junk basket laid out."}, {"id3": "A full BOP test was conducted and the IBOP was changed out. NB#16 was then picked up along with a new MWD tool and new mud motor. The bit was RIH to the shoe and washed down from 3598m to 3993m where weight was taken. Washing and reaming commenced from 3393m to 3398m where reaming became solid. Up to 20klbs was required to ream from 3398m to bottom at 4015m where indications ofjunk in the hole were seen. New 81/2\u201d directional hole was drilled with rotation from 4015m to 4252m using 1.40sg MW. After circulating bottoms up a wiper trip to 3995m was made, backreaming out of the hole with the hole tight and packing off at 4210m, 4205m, 4190m and 4140 to 3995m. The bit was run back in the hole to 4224m with tight spots being washed and reamed. The bit was washed to bottom from 4224m and new 81/2\u201d directional hole with rotation was drilled from 4252m to 4536m. After circulating bottoms up, a wiper trip to 4228m was performed with no significant drag noted whilst backreaming. The bit was RIH to bottom with no indications of tight spots. Connection gas was detected from 4515m."}, {"id4": "Drilling of 81/2\u201d directional hole resumed from 4536m to 4773m where a flowcheck of a 9% gas peak resulted in a static loss of 30 bbls/hr. Bottoms up was circulated whilst pumping LCM to cure the losses. After a 30.9% gas peak was recorded from 4769m, the MW was raised to 1.42sg prior to drilling on. New 81/2\u201d hole was then drilled from 4773 to 4795m with three gas peaks of 17.8%, 20.3 and 15.35% while pumps were off at 4772m, 4778m and 4790m respectively and a maximum gas of 21.95% was recorded from bottoms up. The gas levels remained high ranging from 19 to 21% so the MW was increased to 1.48sg reducing gas levels while circulating to less than 1%. On a subsequent dummy connection however, the gas peak was recorded at 38.3%. The mud weight was then incremented in stages performing full circulations and dummy connections each time. The resulting mud weights and gas peak combinations were 1.52sg/16.9%, 1.54sg/16.7%, 1.56sg/20.9%, 1.58sg/25.2%, 1.60sg/26.0%, 1.62sg/51.3% (after wiper trip to shoe), 1.63sg/26.3, 1.64sg/22.5%, 1.66sg/31.4%, 1.68sg/34.3%, 1.70sg/O.84%. It was then deduced that the bottom hole pore pressure was at 1.69sg, a level extremely close to the 1.69sg LOT result."}, {"id5": "An MWD wipe log (Sonic-Resistivity-GR-Caliper) was conducted for the entire open hole and then it was decided to run wireline logs. The wireline tool was not able to pass through 3823m so after conducting velocity survey inside the 9 5/8\u201d casing, it was decided to run a clean-out assembly with the MWD tool again (due to caliper failure on previous run). After the clean-out/MWD log run, the wireline log was attempted again but could not pass through 3922m. The wireline tool was then pulled out and Abalone-1 was then plugged and abandoned."}, {"id6": "Japcx AC, Ltd: Abalone-1"}]
