The assembly was run in hole picking up 12 joints of heavy weight drill pipes. Precautionary washing and reaming was started from 1700m and progressed smoothly down to 2318m where the string suddenly became stuck. The pipe was worked and rotated while gel mud was spotted but no returns were observed on the seabed. After several hours of working pipe, the free point indicator was run and found the pipe was stuck at 1809.5m. Working pipe continued with a maximum overpull of 630 klbs. A small amount of returns was then noted on the seabed. A 300be gel pill was then pumped and full returns were gained. The pipe then came free using a 600klbs overpull. The string was then pulled out of hole back-reaming and pumping gel pills on tight spots as required."}, {"id20": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id21": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id22": "Page 2.1.11"}]
