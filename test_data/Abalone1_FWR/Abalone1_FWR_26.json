The string was then run in hole to the 9.625\u201d casing shoe at 3599m, before slipping and cutting drilling line. Once on bottom, the toolface was oriented in the target direction and a sequence of directional and rotational drilling commenced. Directional surveys were taken as required in order to steer the bit and build hole angle. However, after progressing 88 metres, the bit was proving very difficult to steer and when the last survey showed that the hole angle had still not increased, the decision was made to change the bit. After circulating returns at 3703m, the bit was pulled to surface, encountering a tight spot at 3632m with about 30 klbs overpull, which required some backreaming and washing to work through."}, {"id20": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id21": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id22": "Page 2.1.19"}]
