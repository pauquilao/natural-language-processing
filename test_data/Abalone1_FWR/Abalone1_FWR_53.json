There was no significant deviation from the normal Dxc trendline established in this hole section. There was a leftward shift on the Dxc trend within the Oliver formation from 1100m to 1180m but this was attributable to the interval\u2019s interbedded lithological variation. The same Dxc trend was noted within the Prion/Hibernia formation from 1530m to 1590m caused again by local changes in lithology. The Dxc baseline dramatically shifted at the top of the Grebe formation and then maintained a normal rightward trend within the formation. The normal Dxc trend then continued to 2560m with baseline shifts noted at the start of each formation. On the original hole, the base Basset exhibited a rightward but deviant Dxc curve inconsistent with the normal compaction slope and indicated an extraordinarily lithified sedimentary facies. This trend was not interpreted as an impermeable, sedimentary layer of the Basset or a prelude to an abnormal pressure regime underneath but was more likely to have been caused by either or a combination of both drilling parameter and hole condition changes. This interpretation was confirmed by the normal Dxc trend recorded when the hole was plugged back and deviated from 2228m to 2560m. The pore pressure of the 171/2\" hole section was estimated to be normal at 1.0389 EMD."}, {"id10": "12 1A\" Hole Section"}, {"id11": "The 12 1A\u201d hole section was drilled from 2560m to 3613m with a KCI/PHPA/Glycol mud system at a density ranging from 1.05sg to 1.14sg. Dynamic losses to the formation started around 2800m with the ECD measured at 1.09sg and continued at varying levels down to the total section depth. Static loss from 2790m to 3000m was measured at 7bbls/hr with the MW at 1.0689. The upper part of this hole section between 2560 and 3352m was drilled fast with the sandy beds showing two distinct shifts in drilling exponent baselines. This upper sandy section and the underlying intercalation of siltstone and sandstone beds of Prudhoe formation was normally pressured. From 3040m to 3180m a leftward shift in the Dxc, an increase in background gas and the trend of the resistivity curve indicated a zone of minor overpressure. Below 3100m, with the mud weight measured at 1.1089 the background gas was seen to have increased to 0.4% at about 3190m before gradually decreasing again to its previous level of 0.1% once drilling got past this zone. From 3350m to 3420m, there were swabbed gases generated and tight hole problems have occurred. These problems were cured by increasing the mud weight to 1.1489. The gas background then remained minimal below 3420m and continued well within the Jamieson formation down to the 9 5/8\u201d casing shoe at 3599m."}, {"id12": "Although there were significant gases and hole problems experienced from 3100m and below, the interval was still interpreted to have been at a normal pore pressure regime.
