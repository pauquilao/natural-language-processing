[{"id1": "Operations Summary"}, {"id2": "The top of cement plug was tagged at 2340m and the mud motor was orientated to sidetrack past the fish. After sliding and rotating to 2447m, the assembly could not build angle more than the 2.1deg inclination. The bit was then tripped out and a stinger was RIH to set another cement plug. While RIH the drill pipe stinger got stuck and was worked free at 2140m. The stinger was then tripped to bottom but before cementing operations could start, the stinger got stuck at 2443m. After several hrs of working pipe and several hundred barrels of gel pumped in, the stinger was freed and tripped to surface. A hole conditioning assembly was run in, washed and reamed from 1753m to bottom at 2447m and was pulled out to set another cement plug. The drillpipe stinger was again made up, run in to bottom and pumped cement plug #4 with an estimated top at 2226m. Ten stands of the pipe were pulled out and the stinger was then circulated with seawater, flushing the choke and kill lines. The string was pulled into the shoe while WOC and rig maintenance was made. The string was RIH to tag the top of the cement plug until the hole got tight with the stinger becoming stuck for several hours at 2168m. When eventually freed, the stinger was pulled out of hole and a clean-out assembly was run in to condition the hole and tag the top of plug. After locating the top of cement at 2228m, the assembly was pulled out to pick up the second sidetrack assembly."}, {"id3": "RR#SC bit was made up with the mud motor and DGWD tool and RIH to sidetrack past the fish. The assembly managed to drill past the fish when at 2560m, the bottom part of the assembly below the accelerator twisted off. An overshot fishing assembly was made up and run in. The hole was noted good and light washing was made to the top of fish at 2405m. The fish was caught and was freed by 450klbs overpull. After a slow trip to surface, the fish was laid out and the fishing BHA laid out for inspection."}, {"id4": "NB #6 was then made up with a pendulum assembly and RIH. Light washing and reaming was done as a precaution from 1700m to 2318m when the string suddenly got stuck. For more than one day, the stuck pipe was worked to a maximum of 630kle and gel pills were pumped with no returns seen on the seabed. Schlumberger FPIT run, indicating pipe was stuck at 1809.5m. When slight returns were noted at the dump valve, a 300 bbl gel pill was then circulated gaining full circulation. The pipe was then freed with 600kle overpull. The string was pulled out of hole back-reaming tight spots and pumping gels as required. On surface, the motor and DGWD tool were laid out and the same bit was made up with a slick bottom hole assembly and RIH to condition the hole prior to the 13 3/8\u201d casing run. Circulation was broken at 1700m confirming returns at the riser dump valve. The bit then washed and reamed to bottom at 2560m using gel mud. A 620be gel pill was pumped and chased with 147bbls of seawater while working the pipe with no returns noted at the dump valve. The assembly was then pulled out of hole to run the 13 3/8\u201d casing. The 13 3/8\u201d casing shoe was set at 2547m"}, {"id5": "For the 12%\u201d hole the cement, shoe track and three metres of new formation to 2563m were drilled out with NB#7 a PDC bit. The mud was conditioned and balanced at 1.0539 and a Leak-Off Test (LOT) was performed, yielding an 1.153g EMW. The bit then continued to drill new 12%\u201d hole from 2563m to 3004m flowchecking as required. A bit trip was made at 3004m with no excess overpull. The new bit was made up, dressed and RIH to 2902m and washed and reamed to bottom. New 12- %\u201d hole was drilled from 3004m to 3355m flowchecking as required and circulating for samples at 3249m. A tight spot at 3198m was seen at a connection. At 3355m the bit was pulled out of hole to pick up the kick off BHA. The new BHA was made up and RIH to 3328m and washed and reamed to bottom at 3355m. New 12-%\u201d directional hole was drilled from 3355m to 3384m with alternating periods of sliding and rotation. Rapidly rising gas levels up to 38% were observed and the well was shut in, recording zero pressures. The well was opened and the MW was raised to 1.1259 whilst circulating the well until background gas levels dropped to a range of 0.8% - 1.0%. A flowcheck was performed and the bit was pulled out to 3121m. The bit was run back to bottom and bottoms up was circulated whilst the MW was raised to 1.1359.
