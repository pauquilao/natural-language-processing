The leak-off test result at 1.34sg, however, was found to be valid only around the immediate vicinity of the casing shoe. Flow checks made at 1290m, 1415m, 1737m and 2170m recorded losses at a rate of 78bbls/hr, 90bbls/hr, 220bbls/hr and 240bbls/hr respectively. By using an open-ended fluid system with returns initially dumped at the shakers and by opening the riser dump valve at 2447m, there was no way of observing how much the effective circulating density contributed to the fluid system loss. Based on the static flow checks, the minimum fracture pressure gradient in this hole section was placed at 1.03sg."}, {"id7": "12%\u201dHole Section"}, {"id8": "This section was drilled with a KCI PHPA mud system. Using a 1.05sg mud the leak off test recorded a formation strength of 1.15sg EMW. During drilling, dynamic losses ranging from 7 to 13 bbls/hr were recorded while using 1.09 to 1.17sg effective circulating density. Since the losses were all recorded over a period of time, it was likely that the drilling fluid seepages were controlled by weak planes or voids withn the arenaceous lithology at this depth interval. There was a static loss of 8 bbls/hr observed while logging the hole between 3420m and 3599m when the mud weight was at 1.14sg. This static loss was generally attributed to the weak sand consolidation although it was also likely that the formation competency was lower near the bottom hole section. The fracture pressure of the 12% hole section was thus placed at about 1.14sg to 1.15sg EMW."}, {"id9": "8\u2018/2\u201dHo|e Section"}, {"id10": "This section was drilled using the same mud system as above. The formation integrity test at the casing shoe was subsequently recorded at 1.693g EMW. There have been no mud losses observed while drilling from the casing shoe to 4795m. Abnormal pressure regime encountered at the lower part of the hole section required the gradual addition of weighting material to the mud system. The mud density was raised in stages from 1.42sg to 1.7OSg each time observing the influx of gas into the wellbore and also any downhole seepages that may require treatment of loss circulation material. The mud weight was successfully incremented to 1.7OSg and when flow rates induced an ECD of 1.768g EMW, losses to the formation ensued. The loss however was stopped when the pump flow rates reduced the effective circulating density to 1.75sg EMW. The fracture pressure of the 81/2\u201d hole section was therefore placed at 1.76sg EMW."}, {"id11": "J apex AC Ltd: Abalone-1 Page 4.2.1"}]
