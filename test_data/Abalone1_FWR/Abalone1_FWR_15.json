The stinger was run into 2430m where an attempt at breaking circulation was made with the cement head stand. Circulation could not be established due to a suspected blockage so the stinger was pulled up to 1651m where circulation was successfully established. The stinger was run back in to 2447m washing down the last metre. A 1000bbls of seawater was circulated followed by 1000bbls of high viscosity gel and another 100bbls of seawater. A 100be LCM pill was then pumped and chased with 20bes of seawater. After the cement lines were tested to 2000psi, a balanced cement plug was pumped consisting of 957 sacks of class \u201cG\u201d cement at 16.5ppg and displaced with 10bes of mixwater and 100bes of seawater. The stinger was pulled back to 2143m where bottoms up was circulated before pulling back to the shoe at 725m. The BOP\u2019s were function tested and the stinger was run back in the hole tagging cement at 2331m.
