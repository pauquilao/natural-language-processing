A 26\u201d bit was made up with a 36\u201d hole opener and run in tagging the seabed at 431mRT. Abalone-1 was spudded at 20:15hrs on 04 September 2000. The section was drilled using seawater, with hi-vis pre- hydrated gel (PHG) sweeps pumped every single. At section TD of 478mRT, a 100bbls hi-vis PHG pill was pumped and displaced with 280bbls high vis. A Totco survey was dropped before pulling out of hole to run the 30\u201d conductor casing."}, {"id30": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1 Page 2.1.1"}]
