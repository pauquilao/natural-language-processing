[{"id1": "Operations Summary"}, {"id2": "3384m to 3399m where the bit became stuck on bottom. The bit was worked and jarred free with a max overpull of 185klbs. Directional drilling resumed from 3399m to 3419m where the bit was pulled out of the hole due to difficulty holding toolface. NB#1O Tricone Bit was then made up and run in to 3417m with two metres of fill recorded. The bit however, was unable to drill with no torque or standpipe pressure seen at surface. The bit was pulled out and it was seen that the mud motor had failed. The bit was re-run in the hole after picking up a new mud motor to 3379m and washed and reamed to bottom at 3419m. New 12%;\u201d directional hole was drilled from 3419m to 3550m where a ten stand wiper trip was performed prior to drilling on from 3550m to 3613m. A wiper trip to the shoe and back to bottom was made before the assembly was pulled out of the hole to run wireline logs. On completion of wireline logging the 9-5/8\u201d casing was run and set at 3599m."}, {"id3": "After drilling 2m of 81/2\u201d hole, the clean out bit was pulled inside the casing and a leak off test was then conducted recording a formation strength of 1.69sg EMW at the casing shoe depth of 3599m. A PDC bit was then run and the 81/2\u201d hole was continued rotating and sliding to 3703m. At this depth the hole was circulated clean before the bit was pulled out to surface due to difficulty holding toolface. A new tricone bit was picked up and was RIH with the mud motor and MWD tool. The assembly was held up at 3608m hence washing and reaming was started from there to the bottom. Directional drilling then re-started and reached 3832m in 31.3hrs. After circulating bottoms up, the bit was pulled to surface and laid out. A new PDC bit was made up with the directional assembly and was RIH. Tight spot was again noted at 3606m. Reaming was done from this depth to 3678m. The hole was slick from 3678m to 3794m but needed washing and reaming below that zone to the bottom. Directional drilling continued from 3832m until 3896m where the MWD tool shutdown. The assembly was pulled to surface after circulating the hole clean and a static flowcheck made at the shoe. On surface the MWD data was downloaded and the tool was laid out."}, {"id4": "NB#14, a mill tooth bit was made up with a new MWD tool and RIH to 3610m then washed and reamed to bottom at 3896m. New 81/2\u201d directional hole was drilled from 3896m to 4014m sliding and rotating as required. After circulating bottoms up, a wiper trip to the shoe was made. The bit held up at 3995m with no circulation possible due to the hole packing off. The bit was worked and backreamed without circulation to 3823m. When circulation was regained, the bit was backreamed to 3679m where the hole packed off again until 3640m. The bit was backreamed to the shoe and after a flowcheck a slug pumped and the bit pulled out to surface. The MWD tool was laid out at surface having suffered severe heat damage from backreaming out of the hole without circulation noting the loss of forty metal resistivity antenna protectors consequently left as junk in the hole. The mud motor was laid out and a clean-out BHA with a junk sub and mill tooth bit was made up and RIH to 3598m. The bit washed and reamed to bottom at 4014m with numerous tight spots encountered and packing off at 3803m."}, {"id5": "Once on bottom, the junk sub was worked and one metre of new formation drilled whilst increasing the MW to 1.31sg. After circulating the hole clean the bit was pulled out to 3987m where the hole again packed off. The pipe was worked to re-gain circulation and a high viscosity sweep was pumped and the MW was further increased to 1.37sg. The bit was then backreamed to the casing shoe with a recorded drag of between 0-20klbs. Bottoms up was circulated at the shoe prior to attempting to RIH. The bit held up at 3629m and was washed and reamed down to bottom with up to 35kle weight needed to clear various tight spots. Once on bottom a high viscosity pill was swept around the hole. The bit was then backreamed to the shoe again but with a less amount of drag encountered compared to the previous trip. After a TDS service at the shoe the bit was RIH to 3992m washing and reaming as required. A high viscosity pill was swept around the hole whilst reaming from 3992m to 3998m where 20klbs weight was taken. The bit was reamed to 4005m where the bit held up with 24klbs of weight. A further high viscosity pill was swept around the hole before pulling/ pumping out to the shoe with no rotary motion required. After a flowcheck, the bit was RIH to 3615m where weight was taken and washed and reamed to 3643m. The pipe was worked"}, {"id6": "Japex AC, Ltd: Abalone-1"}]
