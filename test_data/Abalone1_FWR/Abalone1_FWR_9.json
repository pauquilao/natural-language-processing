Cement, the shoe at 475mRT and shoe track to 478mRT were drilled out. New formation was drilled using seawater with alternating 50 bbl hi-vis PHG and 50 bbl hi-vis guar gum sweeps pumped every 15 metres. Drilling averaged 43m/hr until the section TD was reached at 732mRT. The hole was swept with a 100 bbl hi-vis mud and then displaced with 700 bbls of hi-vis gel followed by a 50 bbl CaCO3 LCM pill. A Totco survey was dropped and the bit was then pulled out of hole to run 20\u201d casing."}, {"id30": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id31": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id32": "Page 2.1.2"}]
