After an FEWD test and top drive service, the assembly was run in hole to 3328m. From this depth the bit washed and reamed from down to 3355m. Drilling then commenced from 3355m until 3384m where the well was shut in and the returns and gas were circulated out. The mud weight was then raised to 1.12sg. The bit was run back to 3384m and the mud weight was raised further to 1.13sg. Drilling 12%\u201d directional hole then continued from 3384m to 3399m. The bit got stuck on bottom but was worked and jarred free. Drilling resumed and at 3419m after circulating returns, a flow check was made and the bit was pulled out to surface."}, {"id28": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id29": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id30": "Page 2.1.15"}]
