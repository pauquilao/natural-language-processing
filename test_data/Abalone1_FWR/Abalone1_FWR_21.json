The assembly was run in hole to the 13 3/8\u201d casing shoe. After servicing the top drive the bit was tripped in hole to 2902m where the string took weight. Reaming began from 2902m and continued down to 3004m. The bit then commenced drilling new formation from 3004m. At 3198m a flowcheck was made on a drilling break. Drilling continued making flowchecks as required with directional surveys taken on connections. Returns were circulated at 3249m before drilling continued to 3290m. The bit was then pulled out of hole at 3355m due to difficulty holding toolface after the cuttings were circulated out."}, {"id20": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id21": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id22": "Page 2.1.14"}]
