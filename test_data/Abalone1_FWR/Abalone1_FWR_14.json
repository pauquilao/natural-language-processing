The drill line was slipped and cut, the TDS system was serviced and other rig maintenance was carried out whilst waiting on cement. The bit was then run in to 1740m and washed and reamed from 1740m to the top of the cement plug at 2340m. Cement was drilled with rotation for 1 metre and a survey was taken before aligning the toolface. The bit was then control drilled and a kickoff established from 2341m to 2353m. Drilling whilst sliding continued from 2353m to 2447m with the angle dropping off. A 200be gel pill was then spotted on bottom. The bit was pulled out because the assembly failed to build enough inclination to safely pass the fish. The bit was pulled back to 2308m where bottoms up was circulated.
