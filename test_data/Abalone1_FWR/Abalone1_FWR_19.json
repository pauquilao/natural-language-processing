The same bit was picked up and made up with a slick bottom hole assembly and run in to condition the hole. The pumps were started at 1700m with returns confirmed at the riser dump valve. The bit washed and reamed from 1700m to the bottom at 2560m using pre-hydrated gel mud system. The hole was circulated clean and a 620be gel pill was then pumped chased with 147bbls of seawater. There was no returns noted at the dump valve. The assembly was then pulled out of hole to run 13 3/8\u201d casing."}, {"id20": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id21": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id22": "Page 2.1.12"}]
