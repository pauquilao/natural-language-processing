The assembly was run in and cement was tagged at 2545mRT. The casing shoe, rat hole and three metres of new formation were drilled to 2563mRT. The hole then was displaced to a 1.05sg KCl/PHPA/Glycol (Aquadrill) mud whilst drilling out the shoe. After circulating the hole clean the bit was pulled back into the shoe. A Leak-Off Test (LOT) was performed with 360psi surface pressure on 1.05sg mud yielding an EMW of 1.15sg. Drilling then resumed down to 2815mRT where the mud was circulated for conditioning prior to drilling to 3004m, flowchecking as required. At 3004m returns were circulated and the hole flowchecked before pulling out for a bit change, due to poor penetration rates."}, {"id29": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id30": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id31": "Page 2.1.13"}]
