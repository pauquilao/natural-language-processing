The string was then run in hole. Once on bottom, the toolface was oriented and a combination of directional and rotational drilling used in order to steer the bit and build hole angle to about 27\u00b0 inclination. Directional surveys were taken as required. Once the planned hole angle was reached at about 3796m, it was decided to drill further. However, after penetration rates dropped consistently below 3m/hr, the decision was made to pull out of the hole. On the trip out, a number of high side tight spots, from 3810 to 3620m, required backreaming."}, {"id19": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id20": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id21": "Page 2.1.20"}]
