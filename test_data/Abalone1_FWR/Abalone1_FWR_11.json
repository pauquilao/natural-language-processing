The bit was washed and reamed down from 1146m to 1169m where there was a problem during a connection with the RBS tool. Troubleshoot RBS tool and continue to wash and ream from 1169m to bottom. New formation was drilled ahead from 1254m to 1737m using seawater and alternating high-vis PHG and high-vis guar gum sweeps pumped every stand. Surveys were taken every two stands. At 1735m a sharp drilling break occurred and a 50% reduction in return flow was noted. A flow check was performed at 1737m and static losses of 220 bbls/hr were observed. Drilling ahead continued from 1737m to 1763m with partial returns between 40% and 70%. At 1763m a 50be gel sweep was circulated around and a 100be gel pill was spotted on bottom. A short wiper trip to 1082m was then performed with no indications of overpull or of fill on the trip back to bottom. Drilling ahead then continued from 1763m to 2149m. Circulation was briefly lost at 1905m and again at 1930m but was quickly re-established and in general returns averaged between 40% and 80%. At 2149m it was noticed that a roller on the travelling block carriage was rubbing the top block"}, {"id20": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id21": "Drilling And Engineering"}, {"id22": "Page 2.1.4"}]
