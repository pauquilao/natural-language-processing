[{"id1": "3.1 Geology and Shows GEOLOGY AND SHOWS"}, {"id2": "Formation Evaluation for Abalone-1 commenced from below the 20\u201d casing shoe that was set at 725m. Through the 171/2\u201d hole section samples were collected at 10 metre intervals from 732m to 2440m. Occasionally due to lack of returns no sample was collected. Intermittent increased rate of penetration resulted in the sample interval being increased to 20m. From 2440m to the bottom of the 171/2\u201d hole section at 2560m, returns were dumped on the sea floor through the riser relief valve. Through the 12%\u201d hole section samples were collected at 10 metre intervals from 2560m to 2750m. From 2750m to the bottom of the 12%\u201d section at 3613m cuttings were collected at 3 metre intervals. Three metre interval cuttings were also collected throughout the 81/2\u201d hole section from 3617m to T.D. at 4795m. During the course of the well, all gas equipment was calibrated and checked regularly. Cuttings samples were calcimetry tested at intervals specified by the Japex Wellsite Geologists. A ruptured sample gasline was found and repaired at 2930m. Because of this, gas data is questionable from 2530m to 2930m."}, {"id3": "The lithological units observed in Abalone-1 are described below.
