The eight stand stinger assembly and the well head joint was then made up with the casing string and was run in hole using 5\u201d drill pipe running tool. The assembly was landed and confirmed with 25 klbs overpull. The cement lines were rigged up and tested to 3000psi. Cement operations followed as per program. Good returns was observed while pumping the lead slurry but none was seen when pumping the tail slurry and during the displacement. The running tool was then released and pulled out of hole to run the BOP stack."}, {"id26": "J apex AC Ltd: Abalone-1"}, {"id27": "Drilling and Engineering"}, {"id28": "Page 2.2.2"}]
