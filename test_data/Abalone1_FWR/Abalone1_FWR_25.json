The assembly was run in hole, filling pipe every 20 stands with 1.15 sg Aquadrill mud. Just after tagging hard cement at 3532m, the casing was displaced to the new Aquadrill mud of 1.26 sg weight. Having drilled out the 9.625\u201d shoe track and the casing shoe at 3599m, the 12%\u201d rathole to 3613m was cleaned out. Two metres of new hole were drilled to 3615m. The junk basket was worked before circulating returns to surface. The marine riser was boosted to further clean the hole. The bit was then pulled back into the shoe and a Leak Off Test (LOT) performed, with 2200 psi applied surface pressure on 1.26 sg mud yielding an EMW of 1.69 sg. The bit was pulled out of the hole to reconfigure the drilling assembly."}, {"id18": "Japex AC Ltd: Abalone-1 Page 2.1.18"}]
